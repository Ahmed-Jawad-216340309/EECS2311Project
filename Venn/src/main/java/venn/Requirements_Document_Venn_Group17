---What is the tool:
	
	Customers are in need of a system which categorizes their data sets into a two-set venn diagram. All essential features of the
	system are described in this document.


---Features:
	
	- Customizable venn diagram circles (color, size)
	- Text boxes can hold up to 25 characters
	- Text boxes are fully enclosed within the circles
	- Text boxes can be added via dropdown menu
	
---Acceptance tests:
	
	- If an object falls into a particular category, we want to test if our venn diagram contains the object. 
	- If an object falls in two categories, we want to test if the objects exists in the intersection of the respective circles.
	- If an object does not fall into any category, we want to test if it does not exists in the venn diagram.
	- An object should not come into contact with the boundary of the circle (ie the object is fully enclosed within the circle).
	- The different circles must be of the same radius
	- The circle have an upper bound radius (due to screen size)
	- The object will have a 25 character limit.
***	- The object is a "dot" which when hovered over, will show the entry
	- The circles will be of different colors
	- The object will be added via clicking options
