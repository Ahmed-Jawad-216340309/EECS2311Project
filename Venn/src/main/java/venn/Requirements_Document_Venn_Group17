---What is the tool:
	
	Customers are in need of a system which categorizes their data sets into a two-set venn diagram. All essential features of the
	system are described in this document.

---Features:
	
	- Customizable venn diagram circles (color, size, border)
	- Text boxes can hold up to 25 characters
	- Text boxes are fully enclosed within the circles
	- Text boxes can be added via dropdown menu
	
---Acceptance tests:
	
	- The dropdown menu will have a 'Customize Circles' menu which would contain options for customizing color, size and borders.
	- When the color option is selected, users can choose 'left circle' or 'right circle', after which a number of preset colors options
	  can be chosen from.
	- When the size option is selected, users can choose between 10 preset sizes or set a custom, numerical radius size for the circles. 
	  The circles will be of equal radius so one circle cannot be bigger than another.
	- When the border option is selected, users will have two options given. The first will be stroke width, which after clicking will 
	  allow the user to choose between a variety of widths. The second option will be stroke color, which after clicking will allow the 
	  user to choose the border stroke color from a variety of preset colors options.
	- Users can add text boxes by selecting a dropdown menu option 'Add Text Box'. Doing so will add a new text box in a list to at the 
	  right side of the window. This list represents the text box being in none of the two sets.
	- The contents of any text box can be renamed after clicking it. The text boxes can also be dragged into either circles or their 
	  conjunction.
