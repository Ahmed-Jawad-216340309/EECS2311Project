---What is the tool?

	This tool is a visual mathematical tool to categorize entities in a venn diagram format which makes use of the set base mathematics. 
	The venn diagram are mainly a combination of two or more circular objects which is a composition of one or more objects.

---Uses cases?
	- 

---Acceptance tests?
	
	- If an object falls into a particular category, we want to test if our venn diagram contains the object. 
	- If an object falls in two categories, we want to test if the objects exists in the intersection of the respective circles.
	- If an object does not fall into any category, we want to test if it does not exists in the venn diagram.
	- An object should not come into contact with the boundary of the circle (ie the object is fully enclosed within the circle).
	- The different circles must be of the same radius
	- The circle have an upper bound radius (due to screen size)
	- The object will have a 25 character limit.
***	- The object is a "dot" which when hovered over, will show the entry 
	- The circles will be of different colors
	- The object will be added via clicking options
	-
